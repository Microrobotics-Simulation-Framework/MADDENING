"""Delete persistent XLA compilation-cache entries that JAX could not read back.

CI saves each shard's compilation cache after a push run, and every later
pull request restores it.  JAX writes an entry in place -- no temporary
file and rename -- and never rewrites an entry whose file exists, and the
test lanes' subprocesses inherit ``JAX_COMPILATION_CACHE_DIR``: a child
killed mid-write (a timeout, a crash) leaves a truncated entry under its
final name, for good.  Reading one makes JAX warn "Error reading
persistent compilation cache entry", and the suite's
``filterwarnings = ["error"]`` turns that into a test error on every run
that restores the cache.  So ``ci.yml`` runs this before saving.

An entry is JAX's ``compress_executable`` of a 4-byte big-endian compile
time followed by the serialized executable, compressed with zstandard when
it is installed and zlib otherwise.  An entry is kept only if it
decompresses completely and holds more than the 4-byte header; anything
else is deleted and named.  (The executable itself cannot be checked
without the backend that deserialises it; truncation, the failure mode
here, is caught by decompression: a zstd frame records its content size,
and a zlib stream its end.)

Only regular files in the directory itself are checked; ``*-atime`` files
and ``.lockfile`` (written only when a size cap is set, which CI does not
set) and subdirectories are left alone.  Deleting an entry costs one
recompile, so an unreadable file is always deleted.

Usage::

    python scripts/prune_jax_cache.py <cache dir>

Exit 0 after a scan, whatever it deleted (a GitHub warning annotation
names each deleted entry); 2 if the path exists and is not a directory.
A missing directory is nothing to check (exit 0).
