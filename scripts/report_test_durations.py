"""Report per-test wall-clock from CI, and stop new slow tests landing.

The default CI lane (everything not marked ``@pytest.mark.slow``) grew to
55-78 minutes per lane, and nothing said where the time went: pytest's
``-v`` output carries no durations, and reconstructing them meant scraping
timestamps out of an hour of log.  This script reads the JUnit XML that
pytest writes (``--junitxml``) and puts the answer on the run page.

The time budget it enforces (see ``docs/developer_guide/testing_standards.md``):

under ``--watch-over`` (1 s)
    Fine.
between ``--watch-over`` and ``--slow-over`` (1-5 s)
    The watch list: shown in the summary, worth optimising, not an error.
over ``--slow-over`` (5 s)
    Belongs under ``@pytest.mark.slow`` -- which still runs in
    ``slow-tests.yml``: on a schedule three times a week on ``main`` only
    (GitHub runs a scheduled workflow on the default branch), and on a
    release branch only when someone dispatches it by hand -- unless it
    can be made much faster, or it guards something important enough to
    pay for on every push.  A kept test goes on the allowlist *with the
    reason*.  Unlisted tests over this line get a warning annotation on
    the run.
over ``--fail-over`` (20 s)
    An unlisted test this slow fails the job.  An allowlisted one passes
    -- the allowlist has no ceiling -- but gets a warning annotation, so a
    kept test that regresses from 6 s to 900 s is not silent.

Why the hard line is four times the policy line
-----------------------------------------------
Measured on eight green lane-runs of the same tree (2026-09-24): a test
whose median was over 2 s varied between runs by 1.7x at the median and
3.1x at the 90th percentile (2.5x even after normalising each run by its
total).  Runners differ, and a test that compiles something first pays for
every later test that reuses it, so moving one test moves another's time.
A hard gate at 5 s would fail on noise every day.  At 20 s it fires on the
tests that actually drag the lane: the ten slowest tests took 17 minutes.

Why a test is slow
------------------
When the run sets ``MADDENING_TEST_JAX_TIMING=1``, ``tests/_jax_timing.py``
records each test's JAX tracing, lowering, XLA compile and cache-read time,
and how many processes it started, as JUnit properties, and the summary
splits every slow test into

* **compiling** -- XLA backend compilation, the only part a persistent
  compilation cache removes.  JAX's compile timer wraps the whole
  compile-or-read-the-cache call, so on a cache hit what it times *is*
  the cache read; the read is subtracted here and shown on its own;
* **cache read** -- reading compiled programs back from the persistent
  cache, which a warm run pays and a cold run does not;
* **tracing / lowering** -- building the program in Python; no cache
  removes it;
* **running** -- the rest: executing, Python overhead, I/O, and anything a
  subprocess does (its JAX events are not seen here).
  An un-jitted ``for`` loop over ``node.update`` lands here.

JAX's timers can overlap (on jax 0.10.2 a test's tracing has summed to
more than its wall time), so a share is capped at 100% and the diagnosis
says when the parts add up to more than the whole.

Subtracting the compile time gives the time a warm cache cannot remove, on
any run, cold or warm.  A test still over the policy line after that is
listed under *Slow even with a warm cache*: it needs a code change, not a
cache -- unless it started a process, whose compiles are invisible here
and which inherits the cache directory.  Those are listed separately as
*work in a subprocess (not measured here)*.  (A report written before the
process count was recorded cannot tell; there, a test with no JAX activity
at all in the pytest process is put in that list.)

Warm and cold runs
------------------
``--cache-mode`` says what the run's compilation cache was: ``off`` (none),
``cold`` (started empty), ``warm`` (restored from an earlier run), or
``mixed`` (a lane whose shards differed, or one where a shard's mode was
not recorded).  For a report named ``test-results-<x>.xml``, a
``cache-mode-<x>.txt`` beside it (``ci.yml`` writes one per shard) says
what that shard's workflow did, and takes precedence.

A restored cache is not necessarily a used one.  JAX's own cache key
includes the host's CPU features, and runners that report the same CPU
model can differ in them; a shard on such a runner restores a cache and
then misses on almost every lookup.  So a shard is labelled from the
persistent-cache hits and misses its report records: ``warm`` only when a
cache was restored *and* more than ``WARM_HIT_RATE`` of its lookups hit,
otherwise ``restored but unused (cold)``.  The summary prints every
shard's label and hit rate.  (A cold run is not a run without hits: a test
that needs a program an earlier test compiled reads it back from the cache
the run is writing, 17-25% of lookups on CI.)

A warm run's times are not comparable with a cold run's, so the header says
which it was, and a run in which any shard restored a cache does not list
allowlist entries as removable -- a test that is only fast because its
compile was cached is still slow.  A report claimed ``off`` that records
persistent-cache lookups is flagged: a test switched a cache on in-process,
and when the lookups reach more than one file, it left it on for the tests
after it, so those times are partly warm.

The allowlist
-------------
``tests/duration_allowlist.txt``: one pytest node id per line, then
`` # kept: `` and the reason the test must run on every push although it
is over the policy line.  (The ``pending triage`` entries the gate started
with have all been marked slow, sped up or kept.)

Listed tests that no longer run in this lane (marked slow, renamed,
deleted) or now pass under the policy line are reported as removable;
that is advisory, because one fast run is not proof.  A listed test that
was skipped or failed is not: its time says nothing about its cost.  A single shard's
report is not the lane, so the per-shard gate writes no summary and the
lane summary passes ``--no-removable`` when a shard's report is missing.

Usage

::

    MADDENING_TEST_JAX_TIMING=1 python -m pytest ... \\
        --junitxml=test-results.xml -o junit_family=xunit1
    python scripts/report_test_durations.py test-results.xml \\
        --allowlist tests/duration_allowlist.txt --cache-mode cold

Writes Markdown to ``--markdown`` (default ``$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`` when
set), GitHub annotations to stdout, and exits

* 0 -- within budget,
* 1 -- an unlisted test over ``--fail-over``,
* 2 -- nothing to judge: a report missing, unreadable, with no test
  cases, or holding only collection errors (a test file that fails to
  import stops pytest before any test runs).  A gate with nothing to read
  does not pass.  When only some of several reports are collection
  errors, those are left out, a warning names them, and no allowlist entry
  is listed as removable.
