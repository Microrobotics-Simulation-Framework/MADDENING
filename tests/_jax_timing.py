"""Split each test's wall-clock into JAX tracing, lowering and compiling.

A test that is slow on CI is slow for one of three reasons, and each has a
different fix:

* **compiling** -- XLA backend compilation.  A persistent compilation
  cache removes it; so does not recompiling for every Hypothesis example.
* **tracing / lowering** -- Python-side program construction.  No cache
  removes it; rebuilding or retracing a large program per test does.
* **running** -- everything else: executing the program, Python overhead,
  I/O, subprocesses.  An un-jitted ``for`` loop over ``node.update`` lands
  here, thousands of op-by-op dispatches.

JAX already times the first two through :mod:`jax.monitoring`; this module
listens, sums per test (setup + call + teardown, the same span pytest's
JUnit ``time`` covers) and attaches the sums to the test as
``user_properties``, which ``--junitxml`` writes as ``<property>``
elements.  ``scripts/report_test_durations.py`` reads them.

It also counts the processes a test starts (``subprocesses``), from
Python's audit events (PEP 578: ``subprocess.Popen``, ``os.system``,
``os.fork``, ...).  A child's JAX events never reach this process, so a
test whose JAX work runs in a child records no compile here although a
warm cache -- whose directory the child inherits -- may still speed it
up; the report uses the count to say so instead of calling the test
uncacheable.  Not seen: ``multiprocessing`` children started with the
``spawn`` or ``forkserver`` method, which fork without an audit event
(the ``fork`` method raises ``os.fork`` and is counted).

Registered from ``tests/conftest.py`` only when
``MADDENING_TEST_JAX_TIMING=1`` (CI sets it), so local runs are untouched.
Each xdist worker is its own process and records its own tests.
